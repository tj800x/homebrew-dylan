Dylan for Homebrew
##################

This is a fork of the official `Dylan`_ tap for `homebrew`_ to update it to version 2022.1.  
Only the x86_64 architecture is supported at this time.

Mac users can use these formulae to easily install and update Open Dylan
and other tools.

Initial setup
=============

If you don't have homebrew, install it from their `homepage`_.

Then, add this tap::

	brew tap tj800x/dylan

Installing
==========

To install Open Dylan::

	brew install --build-from-source tj800x/dylan/opendylan


Thanks
======

Thanks for the Dart folks whose README, I largely copied
and for motivating me to get this going for Dylan.
